CONTRIBUTING
============
Please note that wjplayer is just a wrapper around [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js) and a bunch of Video.js plugins.
So if you want to contribute to one of these projects, please visit the corresponding github repos.

If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes to wjplayer itself, please do the following:

1. Fork the repository.
1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.
1. Commit and push the topic branch.
1. Make a pull request.

Please note that modifications should follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5). If your editor supports [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/#download) it will make it easier to manage differences from your own coding style.
